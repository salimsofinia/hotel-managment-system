Hotel Management System â€“ Silver Oaks Hotel
About

The Silver Oaks Hotel Management System is a comprehensive desktop application developed using C# and SQL Server, designed to streamline hotel operations. It enables administrators and receptionists to efficiently manage clients, employees, rooms, bookings, packages, payments, and reports within a secure and user-friendly environment.

This system was developed as part of a group project by four contributors from North-West University, aiming to implement a fully functional, role-based management system for hotel operations.
